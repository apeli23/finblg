## Introduction

As a developer, managing the content and data for your website can be tedious. Directus allows you to easily manage your application's content and data, which greatly simplifies the process of development. In this article, we will show you how you can integrate Directus with Next.js so that you can more efficiently create dynamic websites

### Step 1: Install Directus

The first step is to install Directus. Directus can be installed in two ways:

1. Directus CLI - Directus CLI is a command-line tool that enables you to manage your Directus installation. You can configure and manage your Directus instances, obtain their status, check their logs and more with ease.

```
npm install -g directus
```

2. Manual Installation - You can also download the Directus codebase from the official website and install it manually.

### Step 2: Create a Directus project

You can create a Directus project using Directus CLI by running the following command: The project creation command generates the required directory structure, configures your Git repository as well as other settings on your local machine.

```
directus start
```

This command will create a new project in Directus and launch the interface in your browser. You can then log in to the Directus interface, create content and data, and manage it all from there.

### Step 3: Create an API Key

To integrate Directus with Next.js, you will need to create an API key in Directus. Follow these steps:

- Log in to the Directus interface.
- Click on the "Settings" icon in the top-right corner.
- Click on the "API" tab.
- Click on the "Create New Token" button.
- Enter a name for your token and select the permissions you want to grant to the token.
- Click on the "Create Token" button.

Once you have created an API key, you can use it to access your Directus content and data from your Next.js application. You'll be able to use this API key to start building applications that work with Directus' API through our API documentation.

### Step 4: Install Directus SDK

The Directus SDK is a Node.js package that provides direct access to the Directus content and data stream. To install the Directus SDK, run the following command:

```
npm install @directus/sdk
```

### Step 5: Create a Directus Service

The next step is to create a Directus service that will handle the API requests to Directus. If you have created a JavaScript project and have imported the Directus SDK, it should be easy for you to create a Directus service by creating a new JavaScript file in your Next.js project and importing the Directus SDK.

```
import { Directus } from '@directus/sdk';

const directus = new Directus('https://your-directus-url.com');

export default directus;
```

In the above code, replace "https://your-directus-url.com" with the URL of your Directus instance.

### Step 6: Fetch data from Directus

To fetch data from Directus, you can use the Directus SDK in your Next.js pages or components. Here's an example of how to fetch data from a Directus collection:

```
import directus from '../services/directus';

export async function getStaticProps() {
  const { data } = await directus.items('my_collection').readMany();

  return {
    props: {
      items: data,
    },
  };
}

export default function MyComponent({ items }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item) => (
        <li key={item.id}>{item.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

In the above code, we are fetching data from a Directus collection called "my_collection" and passing the data to our component as props.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, integrating Directus with Next.js can be a powerful combination for creating dynamic, data-driven websites. By following the above steps, developers can easily set up Directus, create an API key, install the Directus SDK, create a Directus service, and fetch data from Directus. This integration allows for efficient content and data management, and enables developers to focus on creating engaging user experiences. With Directus and Next.js, the possibilities for building custom web applications are endless.
